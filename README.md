# Description:
The primary objective is to enhance user familiarity with the Dewey Decimal System's top-level categories. This understanding serves as a crucial initial step in the process of locating books within a library. In the context of a smaller library, this knowledge might be sufficient to guide users to their desired books. 

# Installation and Execution
Visual Studio Code

Step 1:
Ensure your computer meets Visual Studio's system requirements.
Check available storage space.

Step 2:
Download Visual Studio from 'https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/'.
Obtain the bootstrapper file.

Step 3:
Run the Bootstrapper to install the Visual Studio Installer.
Select desired workloads and optional individual components.
Choose your preferred language and installation location.

Step 4:
Start coding and enjoy the process! ðŸ˜Š

Step 5:
Download the project code from GitHub.

Step 6:
Open Visual Studio Code.
Click "Open Project" and navigate to the folder containing the developed code.
You now have access to my MVC application.

# Revised Changes Made Based On FEEDBACK:
Replacing Books:
 
 - I've add an introduction.

 - I talked about systems which can implement this feature to motivate.

 - I've displayed ten randomly generated call numbers from 100 to 1000.

 - I've improved the functionality of the gamification and added a timer.

 - I've added more robust error handling to combat bugs that may show themselves.

Identifying Areas:

 - I've put my question and answers into a two-by-two column format.

 - I've improved the  call numbers, now top level only and description

 - I've improved the functionality of the gamification and added a timer.

 - I've added more robust error handling to combat bugs that may show themselves.

# Error Features:
Replacing Books:
No errors. Added improvements based on feedback.

Identifying Areas:
No errors. Added improvements based on feedback.

Finding Call Numbers:
I wasn't able to make the code draw correctly from the JSON file, so the call numbers and their descriptions do not read correctly. The code does have levels and is a functional quiz and it sometimes works as I've shown above in the images, but it messes up the answers sometimes, so some answers go through and some do not. I've added code to make a complete quiz despite the flaws. The progress bar isn't displaying correctly as well. Not sure why, followed a similar logic as part 1 and part 2.'

Thank you for using my application!  ðŸ˜Š
